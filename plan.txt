prompt: You are an AI software architect. I want you to design a **production-ready Python workflow** for a Compliance Assistant application. The requirements are as follows:

**Goal:**  
The application helps a compliance team track prerequisites and notifications for compliance items. It uses LLMs and web scraping to enrich data, and sends notifications through Outlook.

**Requirements / Workflow:**
1. The compliance team submits items via forms (like Excel form entries) containing fields such as:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Responsible Email
   - Due Date
2. The application should store the submitted items in Excel (or a database).
3. For each item:
   - Check if the item already exists in the master compliance list.
   - If it exists, skip or log it.
   - If it does not exist:
     - Use web search (DuckDuckGo) to find relevant prerequisites.
     - Use an LLM (via LangChain) to summarize or extract prerequisites.
     - Store the enriched information in a vector store (LangChain-Groq) for future queries.
4. Send notifications via Outlook to responsible users with the enriched prerequisites.
5. Provide a modular, production-ready structure, including:
   - Folder structure
   - Python module separation (scraper, LLM, notifications, utils, tests)
   - Sample code snippets for main orchestration, Excel read/write, web scraping, LLM query handling, and Outlook notifications
6. Include logging, error handling, and the ability to extend to more compliance sources in the future.
7. Use Python 3.11, latest LangChain, LangChain-Groq, MSAL for Outlook, DuckDuckGo search.

**Deliverables:**
- High-level architecture description.
- Detailed folder structure.
- Skeleton Python code for each module.
- Sample main orchestration file showing end-to-end workflow.
- Explanations/comments so a junior developer can continue building on it.

**Constraints:**
- The code should be clear, modular, and ready for production extension.
- Focus on simplicity first, but include hooks for vector store integration and LLM enrichment.
- No need for a full UI, but ensure it can be integrated later.

Generate the output in a structured way with sections:
1. Architecture Overview
2. Folder Structure
3. Module Descriptions
4. Skeleton Code Examples
5. Sample Orchestration Flow
6. Guidelines for Junior Developer
